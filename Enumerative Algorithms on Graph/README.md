# Running Intructions :-
- To execute a sequential algorithm, compile it using standard c++ compiler and execute the executable
	Example - g++ sequential.cpp
		  ./a.out < ../testcases/1.in 
- to execute a parrelised algorithm, go to the respective folder and execute run.sh file ("bash run.sh")
	The bash script contains the number of processes which can be edited in the file.
# Directory Structure:- 
- there are two main folders for 4-cycles and 3-cycles(triangles).
- Inside triangles folder you have two codes for a simple sequential algorithm and one for parallel one and a folder, which contains patric algorithm.
- Inside 4-cycles folder we have two codes for sequential and parallel algorithm.
